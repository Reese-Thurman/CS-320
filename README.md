Projects from CS-320 (Software Testing, Automation, and Quality Analysis)
1. How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
> The best way to ensure my code is functional and secure is to adhere to industry standard practices and robust testing. These practices included minimizing redundant code, ensuring code reuse, and implementing comments and documentation for every software project. Additionally, early and continuous testing using automated tools ensures that my code is functional, secure, and error free. 
2. How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
> Interpreting user needs can be derived from information provided by stakeholders, including product owners users themselves. User interviews are particularly helpful for understanding user needs. User interview data can be captured in the form of user stories, which are then incorporated into the program itself. Additionally, information provided by product owners can be summarized in technical documents to ensure the software aligns with all business requirements. 
3. How do I approach designing software?
> I would approach designing software using an iterative approach using the Agile methodology along with automated testing. This approach embraces change and user feedback throughout the development lifecycle, which ensures the software addresses user needs. This approach to software design also facilitates early and continuous testing to ensure the software is functional, secure, and error free.
